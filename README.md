If you have the jre installed, you can just open a terminal window and "java main" from within the directory to run.

You may need to specify the path to your jre install, if the above fails. On Windows, jre usually installs to C:\Program Files\Java.

Still very much in early pre-alpha, so expect bugs, glitches, things that make no sense, and unimplemented features.
